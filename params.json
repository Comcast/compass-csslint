{"body":"## Installation\r\n\r\nThere is currently a bug in Compass that prevents external Compass commands from being registered if they're required in a project's config.rb file. So until that is resolved, you'll have to build this custom version of Compass that includes compass-csslint:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Comcast/compass\r\n\r\nClone that project, then from the root run\r\n\r\n    $ gem build compass.gemspec\r\n\r\nOnce that builds, you'll need to first uninstall your existing Compass gem\r\n\r\n    $ gem uninstall compass\r\n\r\nAnd then install your locally-built version of Compass\r\n\r\n    $ gem install compass-0.12.2.b2400e9.gem\r\n\r\nOnce that is installed, you can safely install compass-csslint. Clone the repo:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Comcast/compass-csslint\r\n\r\nFrom the root of that project run\r\n\r\n    $ gem build compass-csslint.gemspec\r\n\r\nAnd then install your locally-built version of the gem\r\n\r\n    $ gem install compass-csslint-0.0.1.gem\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nRun the following command from the root of your Compass project:\r\n\r\n    $ compass csslint\r\n\r\nTo view options:\r\n\r\n    $ compass csslint --help\r\n\r\n## Additional Links\r\n\r\nFor a bare-bones sample project to see this in action, checkout the [compass-csslint-sample](https://github.com/Comcast/compass-csslint-sample) repo\r\n\r\nTo run CSS Lint without Compass, you can use the standalone ruby gem:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install css_lint_ruby\r\n\r\n\r\n* https://rubygems.org/gems/css_lint\r\n* https://github.com/Comcast/css_lint_ruby\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n\r\n* John Riviello - https://github.com/JohnRiv\r\n* Mike Ball - https://github.com/mdb\r\n\r\nThanks for assistance and contributions:\r\n* Jen Valure - https://github.com/calophi\r\n* Mike Rottina - https://github.com/rottina","name":"CSS Lint for SASS & Compass","tagline":"Easily integrate CSS Lint into your projects that use the Compass CSS Framework","google":"UA-35632547-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
