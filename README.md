# CSS Lint for Sass & Compass

Easily integrate Nicholas C. Zakas and Nicole Sullivan's [CSS Lint](http://csslint.net/) into your projects that use the Compass CSS Framework by providing a `compass csslint` command line option.

## Installation

Assuming ruby is installed on your system:

    $ gem install compass-csslint

Note that this requires at least version 1.0.0.alpha.13 of [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) to work properly.

## Usage

Run the following command from the root of your Compass project:

    $ compass csslint

To view options:

    $ compass csslint --help

## Additional Links

For a bare-bones sample project to see this in action, checkout the [compass-csslint-sample](https://github.com/Comcast/compass-csslint-sample) repo

To run CSS Lint without Compass, you can use the standalone ruby gem:

    $ gem install css_lint_ruby
